This part of the project establish Arduino code that with no effort allows you to communicate with your LED strips. Project is focused on WS2812b LED strips as they are one of the cheapest and powerful available on the market.

# Setup

## Installation
Just download Arduino code and put it on the board

## Connection
WS28212b standard uses three pins (5V, GND, DI) and they must be connected to Arduino board. For default it uses pin number 6 to send digital signals.
